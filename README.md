# Valorant-Instalocker
A script you can use to instalock agents in Valorant agent select.

Download python and start the main.py file. Make sure to move the window so it doesn't cover any of the agents on the screen. Once the window pops up select the agent you want to play. 
Wait for the game to load into the agent select menu and enjoy your insta lock!
